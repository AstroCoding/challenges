# challenges
A repo for all of my coding challenges to go to

This is simply a place where I upload my different attempts at coding challenges I find online.
All of the code here is meant to be used as a way of learning, both for me and for others.
This challenges will only be meeting the minimum requirements because expansions are something I want to leave to you guys.
