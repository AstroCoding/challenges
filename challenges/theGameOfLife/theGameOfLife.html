  <h1>The Game of Life</h1>
  <h4>By John Conway</h4>
  <p>This is a population game in which represents living and dead communities. This to make it more interesting, this
    map is like a spherical map, meaning neighbors includes those not directly beside a cell.</p>

  <p>It generates a random starting array and then carries out the 3 rules over and over.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If a black cell has 3 white cells surrounding it, it becomes white.</li>
    <li>If a white cell has less than 2 white cells or more than 3 white cells, it becomes black.</li>
    <li>In all other cases, the state of a cell remains unchanged.</li>In
  </ul>

  <p>You'll notice different shapes and patterns and eventually, it will stop.</p>
